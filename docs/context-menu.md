## Editor Auto-Detection

Markify automatically detects which editors are installed on your system.

### How Detection Works:
1. Checks if editor command exists in PATH
2. Uses `which` (macOS/Linux) or `where` (Windows)
3. Adds detected editors to context menu
4. Only shows editors that are actually available

### Supported Editor Commands:
- `code` - Visual Studio Code
- `cursor` - Cursor
- `vim` - Vim
- `nvim` - Neovim
- `subl` - Sublime Text
- `atom` - Atom
- `emacs` - Emacs

**Note:** If an editor isn't detected, check that its CLI tool is installed and in your PATH.

## Line Number Support

When opening files in editors, Markify can pass the line number.

### How It Works:
1. Markify tracks cursor position (from Neovim metadata)
2. Passes line number to editor when opening
3. Editor jumps to that line automatically

### Supported Editors:
‚úÖ **VS Code**: `code --goto file:42`
‚úÖ **Cursor**: `cursor --goto file:42`
‚úÖ **Vim**: `vim +42 file`
‚úÖ **Neovim**: `nvim +42 file`
‚úÖ **Sublime Text**: `subl file:42`

### Not Supported:
‚ùå **System Default**: No line number
‚ùå **Custom editors**: Depends on configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Context Menu Not Appearing?

**Possible causes:**
- Clicking on a **folder** (not yet supported)
- Clicking on **empty space** in file tree
- Not in a folder view (open a folder first)

**Solution:**
- Ensure you've opened a **folder** in Markify
- Right-click directly on a **file** name
- Make sure file tree is visible (sidebar not collapsed)

### Editor Not in List?

**Possible causes:**
- Editor not installed
- CLI tool not in PATH
- Editor not configured

**Solution:**
- Install the editor
- Add editor CLI to PATH
- Or manually add to `markify-config.json`

### Line Numbers Not Working?

**Possible causes:**
- Editor doesn't support line number syntax
- Custom editor not configured correctly
- Neovim metadata not available

**Solution:**
- Check [Editor Configuration](./editor-configuration.md) guide
- Verify editor command syntax
- Set up Neovim integration if using Neovim

### Editor Opens But Wrong File?

**This shouldn't happen, but if it does:**
- Check that file paths don't have special characters
- Ensure file hasn't been moved/renamed recently
- Restart Markify
