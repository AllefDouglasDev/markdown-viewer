# Test Navigation - Page 1

This is the first test page for internal navigation.

## Links to other pages

Click on this link to navigate to the second page: [Go to Page 2](./test-nav-2.md)

You can also use relative paths like [Another link to Page 2](test-nav-2.md)

## Testing Error Handling

Try clicking this link to a non-existent file: [Broken Link](./non-existent-file.md)

This should show an error message with a "Go Back" button.

## Features Tested

- Internal markdown file navigation
- Relative path resolution
- File watching updates when switching files
- Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Error recovery with back button

## External Links

These should still work normally (opening in browser):
- [Google](https://google.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)

## Same-page Links

These should also work (anchor links):
- [Back to top](#test-navigation---page-1)
